#### Thoughts

This project is very challenging, especially when I must use db.json file as backend, it's lil bit harder to handle data on db.json instead of the real backend. And also since the design on figma is desktop only, i must imagine by myself how the design (responsiveness) on mobile looks alike.

I already tried my best to finish this project based on the task that you give me, but I ran out of time so there are some pages and features that are still not finished yet (my profile and shop, release pokemon). And I believe there is some line of code that could be refactored to make it short and cleaner, and fewer bugs if there is more time.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude for the chance to work on this test project. It has been an exciting challenge that has fueled my passion for software development and strengthened my resolve to continuously strive for excellence.
